This code creates a user-friendly GUI-based contact management system using Python's tkinter library. Here's a summary of what it does:

Features:
Add Contacts: Allows users to input and add new contact names and numbers to the contact list.
Edit Contacts: Users can update selected contact details by selecting and modifying them.
Delete Contacts: Deletes the selected contact from the list.
View Contacts: Displays the details of the selected contact in input fields.
Reset Form: Clears the input fields for fresh entries.
Exit Application: Closes the program.
Key Components:
UI Widgets:

Label: Displays static text like "Name" and "Contact No."
Entry: For inputting name and number.
Listbox: Displays the contact names with scrolling enabled.
Button: Provides actions like Add, Edit, Delete, etc.
Functions:

AddContact(): Appends a new contact to the list and updates the UI.
UpdateDetail(): Updates an existing contact's information.
Delete_Entry(): Removes the selected contact.
VIEW(): Loads selected contact details into input fields.
EntryReset(): Clears the input fields.
EXIT(): Exits the application.
Design & Styling: Uses fonts, colors, and button padding to enhance visual appearance.

Improvements You Can Consider:
Validation: Add checks to ensure valid phone numbers (e.g., no letters in the phone field).
Persistent Storage: Save contacts to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) and load them when the app starts.
Search Feature: Allow searching for specific contacts in the list.
Error Handling: Refine error messages for better user experience.
